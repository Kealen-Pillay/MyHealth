- App Store - IOS Users

Once you have installed the ```Expo Go``` application on your device, you can open a terminal/command shell in the directory you cloned this repository in and run the ```expo start``` command.
This will build the application and produce a QR code which can be scanned to run the application on your physical device.

*** NOTE: Both your physical device and computer that is running the build must be on the same wireless network connection ***

For Android Users: 
- Open the Expo Go application and scan the QR code produced in the terminal.

For IOS Users:
- Open the system built camera application and scan the QR code produced in the terminal.
- This will produce a link in the system built camera application which can be tapped to open the application in the Expo Go application.
